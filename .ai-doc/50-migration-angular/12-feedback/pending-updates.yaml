# Processing Instructions

## For AI Assistants

When discovering something that should be documented:

1. Add entry to `pending_updates` section
2. Use format: `UPDATE-YYYY-NNN`
3. Set appropriate priority
4. Reference discovery context
5. Add to improvement-log.md as well

## For Documentation Maintainers

Weekly process:

1. Review all pending items
2. Prioritize critical and high items
3. Update target files
4. Mark as resolved with date
5. Move to resolved_updates archive

## Priority Guidelines

- **critical**: Blocking migrations, incorrect information
- **high**: Missing common patterns, frequent confusion
- **medium**: Edge cases, improvements
- **low**: Nice-to-have, minor clarifications
