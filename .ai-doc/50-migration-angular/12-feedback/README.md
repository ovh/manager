# Migration Feedback Loop

This directory captures learnings and improvements discovered during migrations.

## Purpose

- **Continuous Improvement**: Document new patterns, pitfalls, and best practices
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Share learnings across teams and AI assistants
- **Documentation Updates**: Track what needs to be added to main docs

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [improvement-log.md](improvement-log.md) | Chronological log of improvements and discoveries |
| [pending-updates.yaml](pending-updates.yaml) | Structured list of pending documentation updates |

## How to Use

### After Each Migration

1. Document any new patterns discovered
2. Log any pitfalls not covered in existing docs
3. Note documentation gaps
4. Add improvement suggestions

### For Documentation Maintainers

1. Review `improvement-log.md` regularly
2. Process items in `pending-updates.yaml`
3. Update main documentation
4. Mark items as resolved

## Integration with AI Workflow

AI assistants should:
1. Check this directory before starting migration
2. Add entries when encountering undocumented scenarios
3. Reference improvement IDs in migration notes
