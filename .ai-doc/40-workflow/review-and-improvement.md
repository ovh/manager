# GitHub Review and Improvement Process

Peer review is one of the most effective ways to maintain high-quality code and improve team collaboration.
It ensures functional and technical consistency, maintainability, and performance.

---

## 🧭 When to Request a Review

Once you have:
- Completed development and local testing of your feature or fix.
- Implemented automated tests (unit, integration if applicable).
- Verified that all GitHub checks pass (linting, DCO, code smell, etc.).

⚠️ *Avoid requesting reviews before CI checks are successful — reviewers’ time must be respected.*

## 👥 Review Requirements

| Contributor Context | Minimum Reviews Required |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Standalone Contributor | 2 approvals from peers |
| Team Contributor | 1 review inside team + 1 outside team |

> No review should occur in isolation, as it reduces objectivity and promotes bad practices.

## 🧩 Review Outcomes

During review, feedback can fall under one of these categories:

| Type | Meaning | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| ✅ **Approval** | The change is accepted as-is. | Merge allowed. |
| ⚙️ **Nitpick (with approval)** | Minor suggestion, optional. | May be applied later. |
| 💬 **Comment (without approval)** | Needs clarification or raises questions. | Requires discussion. |
| ❌ **Request for change** | Blocking issue. | Must be addressed before merge. |

> Performance regressions, security issues, or functional bugs are **blocking** by definition.

## 🧠 Reviewer & Author Guidelines

### Reviewer
- Stay objective and respectful.
- Focus on clarity, correctness, and maintainability.
- Avoid nitpicking unless code clarity or performance is impacted.
- Engage in 1:1 discussion if deeper clarification is needed.

### Author
- Address comments clearly and promptly.
- Re-request review once changes are made.
- Use `git commit --fixup` for incremental adjustments instead of stacking new commits.

## 🔄 After Approvals

| Condition | Action |
|------------|--------|
| All approvals obtained | Merge PR (depending on branch policy). |
| Reviewers disagree | Discuss in chat or meeting before merge. |
| Minor refactors needed | Create a JIRA task or TODO for future fix. |
