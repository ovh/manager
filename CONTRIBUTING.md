# Contributing to Manager

This project accepts contributions. In order to contribute, you should
pay attention to a few things:

1. your code must follow the coding style rules
2. your code must be unit-tested
3. your code must be documented
4. your work must be signed (see below)
5. you may contribute through GitHub [Pull Requests][pull-request] on `develop` branch

# Coding and documentation Style

- Code must be formatted with `yarn run format`
- Code must pass `yarn run test`

# Translations

Due to an internal process, only French sentences can be updated or added.
If you want to make changes in translations from another language, please open
an [Issue](https://github.com/ovh/manager/issues/new/choose).

# Submitting Modifications

The contributions should be submitted through GitHub [Pull Requests][pull-request]
and follow the DCO which is defined below.

# Licensing for new files

Manager is licensed under a BSD 3-Clause license. Anything
contributed to Manager must be released under this license.

# Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

To improve tracking of contributions to this project we will use a
process modeled on the modified DCO 1.1 and use a "sign-off" procedure
on patches that are being emailed around or contributed in any other
way.

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the
patch, which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right
to pass it on as an open-source patch.  The rules are pretty simple:
if you can certify the below:

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have
    the right to submit it under the open source license indicated in
    the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of
    my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source License
    and I have the right under that license to submit that work with
    modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under
    the same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit
    under a different license), as indicated in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person
    who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.

(d) The contribution is made free of any other party's intellectual
    property claims or rights.

(e) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are
    public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.


then you just add a line saying

    Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@example.org>

using your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.)
