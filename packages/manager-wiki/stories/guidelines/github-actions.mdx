## Workflows

### Quality Assurance

#### Linter
```yaml
# .github/workflows/linter.yaml

## Templates

### Pull Request Template
Located at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, this template helps contributors provide necessary information when creating pull requests.

### Release Template
Located at `.github/RELEASE_TEMPLATE.md`, this template standardizes the release process.

### Issue Templates
Located in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`, these templates help users submit well-structured issues.

## Configuration Files

### CODEOWNERS
Located at `.github/CODEOWNERS`, this file defines the default owners for different parts of the codebase.

### Labeler
Located at `.github/labeler.yml`, this configuration automatically labels pull requests based on file changes.

## Best Practices

   - Separate workflows for different concerns
   - Clear naming conventions
   - Proper trigger conditions

2. **Security**
   - No sensitive data in logs
   - Proper secret management
   - Minimal permissions

3. **Performance**
   - Efficient caching
   - Parallel job execution
   - Resource optimization

4. **Maintenance**
   - Regular updates of actions
   - Clear documentation
   - Version pinning

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Workflow Failures**
   - Check Node.js version compatibility
   - Verify dependency versions
   - Review workflow logs

2. **PR Issues**
   - Check labeler configuration
   - Verify CODEOWNERS file
   - Review PR template

3. **Release Issues**
   - Check release template
   - Verify branch protection rules
   - Review release workflow
