## Overview

A `Modal` is used to provide some information to users that needs a response or immediate attention.

## Usage

**Modals** are used in different cases:

- alerting users about something that requires their agreement
- confirming a user decision
- notifying the user of an important information

There are five different subtypes of **Modals** to inform users that a problem requires immediate response from them so the process can continue, depending on the usage:

- **neutral** : reserved for standard alerting
- **information** : provides information to users in context
- **success** : reserved to provide a static persistent success information
- **warning** : reserved for **Modals** that need the user attention and acknowledgment but might not cause errors
- **critical** : reserved for errors, malfunctions, as well as critical issues

They can be dismissable or not.
