# üåç Common Translations

<StorybookHeading label="Overview" level={2} />

The purpose of this package is to maintain the common reusable translations which can be consumed across the ¬µ-apps.

## üìù Contribute to common translations package

Translations are split into multiple folders to facilitate lazy loading with i18next's [namespaces](https://www.i18next.com/principles/namespaces). Each folder must have it's own purpose in the context of it's usage.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Info
>
> Translation keys must be generic and not include any app/module name as prefix/suffix as the content from this package will be made available for all the ¬µ-apps.

### ‚ûï Adding a new Namespace

1. Create a new folder in `packages/manager/modules/common-translations/public/translations`
2. Add `Messages_fr_FR.json` file.
3. Add all the required translations with appropriate keys. 
4. Follow the usual translation process of **Submitting a request** to CMT team and then **Retrieving the translations** to make the corresponding changes in other locale files.

### üîÑ Add/Update translations in existing Namespace

1. Add/Update the required content with appropriate keys in `Messages_fr_FR.json` file.
2. Follow the usual translation process of **Submitting a request** to CMT team and then **Retrieving the translations** to make the corresponding changes in other locale files.

## üöÄ Consuming translations from the package

The "@ovh-ux/manager-common-translations" package provides the following,

1. Content for all the supported locales.
2. A `NAMESPACES` constant to facilitate easy loading of i18next's namespace.

To consume the translations provided by the package,

1. You need to include the package as dependency in your ¬µ-app or other package where you intend to consume it.

    ```json
    {
      ...
      ...
      "dependencies": {
        "@ovh-ux/manager-common-translations": "x.x.x",
        ...
        ...
      }
    }
    ```

2. In your React component, you can consume the translations from the package as shown in the below code-snippet.

    ```
    import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';
    import { NAMESPACES } from '@ovh-ux/manager-common-translations';

    export const ReactComponent = () => {
      ...
      const { t } = useTranslation(NAMESPACES.<NAMESPACE_NAME>);
      ...

      return (
          ...
          <>{{t('<TRANSLATION_KEY>')}}</>
          ...
      );
    }
    ```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
>
> **@ovh-ux/manager-vite-config** automatically includes the translation files in the final bundle of the ¬µ-app. If the base config provided by this package is not consumed in your ¬µ-app, it will be your responsibility to add these files in your bundle.
