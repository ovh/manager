# Move to Manager UI Kit v1

This guide documents the initial migration from `manager-ui-kit` to `manager-ui-kit` within the repository.

## Summary

- Package renamed: `packages/manager-ui-kit` → `packages/manager-ui-kit`.
- New package name: `@ovh-ux/muk`.
- Wiki stories moved to `packages/manager-wiki/stories/manager-ui-kit/**`.
- Root configs updated to reference `packages/manager-ui-kit`.
- Apps and modules were NOT migrated (they still use `@ovh-ux/muk`).

## Install

Update your `package.json` if you plan to adopt the new package in your project:

```json
"@ovh-ux/muk": "^1.x"
```

Import the stylesheet if needed:

```js
import '@ovh-ux/muk/dist/style.css';
```

## Imports (before → after)

```ts
// Before
import { Button } from '@ovh-ux/muk';

// After
import { Button } from '@ovh-ux/muk';
```

Assets referenced from the package should also point to the new scope if you adopt it:

```ts
// Before
import placeholder from '@ovh-ux/muk/public/assets/placeholder.png';

// After
import placeholder from '@ovh-ux/muk/public/assets/placeholder.png';
```

## Storybook structure

- Stories moved from `stories/manager-ui-kit/**` to `stories/manager-ui-kit/**`.
- Sidebar category now appears under "Manager UI Kit/...".

## Quick checklist

- Update imports to `@ovh-ux/muk` (only where migrating now).
- Keep apps/modules unchanged unless explicitly migrating.
- Update CSS import if you rely on the kit’s stylesheet.
