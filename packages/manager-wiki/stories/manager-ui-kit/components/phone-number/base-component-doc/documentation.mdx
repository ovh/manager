<Heading label="Usage" level={ 2 } />

**Phone Number** component should be used when there is a need to collect the user's phone number, in a form for instance:
- An user profile
- A contact/appointment form
- For telecom configuration

<BestPractices
  donts={[
    '- Don\'t enforce a rigid format (e.g., requiring users to enter parentheses or dashes), prioritize forgiving input',
    '- Don\'t make the field required without context. Explain clearly why the phone number is needed (e.g., for account recovery or verification)',
    '- Don\'t assume all users have mobile numbers. Allow landline formats where applicable',
    '- Don\'t display country codes or formats that aren\'t relevant to your supported markets',

![Component anatomy](./base-assets/components/phone-number/anatomy.png "Component anatomy")

1. **Phone Number**
2. **Country selector** - optional
3. **Input field**
4. **Clearable button** - optional

<Heading label="Placement" level={ 2 } />

**Phone Number** is a group of <StorybookLink kind={ REACT_COMPONENTS_TITLE.select } story={ STORY.documentation }>Select</StorybookLink> and <StorybookLink kind={ REACT_COMPONENTS_TITLE.input } story={ STORY.documentation }>Input</StorybookLink>, and should act as their specific placements.

<Heading label="Behavior" level={ 2 } />

When the user selects a country, it determines the format used to validate their phone number. If selected country has been modified, expected format and placeholder will be updated.

If the field content is in error state (i.e. missing or wrong characters), the whole **Phone Number** component becomes in error state.

The country selector allows users to navigate to the desired country option by typing letters while focused on the country selector.

The search is based on the start of the word and functions one letter at a time.

For example:
- Typing "f" focus the first country that starts with "f".
- Typing "r" immediately after focus the first country that starts with "r".

<Heading label="Locale" level={ 3 } />

The locale (i.e. country list translation in <StorybookLink kind={ REACT_COMPONENTS_TITLE.select } story={ STORY.documentation }>Select</StorybookLink>) is first set to the value provided as a property.

If the given property is not defined or recognized, the component attempts to use the browser's locale settings.

If the browser's locale is also not recognized, the component defaults to English (EN).

<Heading label="ISO code" level={ 3 } />

The ISO code is initially set to the value provided as a property.

If the given property is not defined or recognized, the component attempts to determine the ISO code based on the browser's locale.

If the browser's locale is not recognized, the component defaults to the first ISO code in the predefined country list.

<Heading label="Navigation" level={ 2 } />

<Heading label="Focus Management" level={ 3 } />

When the **Phone Number** component is focused, focus is first set to the country selector dropdown, if present, or directly to the Input field.

Each subcomponent (Select and Input) can be focused independently using keyboard navigation.

If the country selector is disabled or not rendered, focus starts directly on the Input field.

<Heading label="General Keyboard Shortcuts" level={ 3 } />

Pressing `Tab` moves focus forward:
* First to the country selector (if present and enabled)
* Then to the Phone Number Input field

Pressing `Shift` + `Tab` moves focus backward through these elements.

While focused on the country selector, keyboard shortcuts are similar to the Select component:
* Pressing `Space` or `Arrow Down` opens the dropdown
* Pressing `Arrow` keys navigates through the list of countries
* Pressing `Home`/`fn`+ `Arrow Up` or `End`/`fn` + `Arrow Down` jumps to the first or last option
* Typing letters focuses the first country whose name starts with the typed character
* Pressing `Enter` or `Tab` selects the focused country and closes the dropdown
* Pressing `Escape` closes the dropdown without selection

While focused on the Input field:
* Typing numeric characters enters the phone number
* Pressing `Backspace` deletes the last character
* Pressing `Arrow Left` or `Arrow Right` moves the cursor within the input

<Heading label="Accessibility" level={ 2 } />

To ensure proper accessibility, the **Phone Number** component must be correctly labeled and provide meaningful context when interactive elements (such as icon buttons) are used.

<Heading label="Always provide an explicit label" level={ 3 } />

Every **Phone Number** must have a clear and explicit label to ensure that users (especially screen reader users) understand its purpose, using either **FormField** or a native label tag.

<OdsCanvas of={ PhoneNumberStories.AccessibilityFormField } sourceState="shown" />

<Icon name={ ICON_NAME.circleCheck }
      style={{ color: 'var(--ods-color-success-500)' }} /> Screen readers will announce the label, the field and its content.

<Heading label="Override action context" level={ 3 } />

To provide more context on the interactive elements, you can provide your own custom translations to the component.

<OdsCanvas of={ PhoneNumberStories.AccessibilityI18n } sourceState="shown" />

<Icon name={ ICON_NAME.circleCheck }
      style={{ color: 'var(--ods-color-success-500)' }} /> Screen readers will announce the label, the field, its content and custom label of focused action.
