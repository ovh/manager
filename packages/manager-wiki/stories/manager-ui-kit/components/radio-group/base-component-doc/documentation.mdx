  **Radio Group** is a group of Radios to select a single state from multiples options.
</IdentityCard>

<Heading label="Usage" level={ 2 } />

In most situations where you want to present a list of mutually exclusive options.

**Radio groups** can be used within a form.

Also, it can serve as :
- Selecting choice
- Lists/sub-lists
- Filters

<Heading label="Dos & Don'ts" level={ 3 } />

<BestPractices
  donts={[
    '- Don\'t use Radio Group when multiple selections are allowed. Use Checkbox instead',
    '- Don\'t use a Radio Group with more than 5 options. Switch to a Select component for better usability',
    '- Avoid situations where all options in a set should be deselected',
    '- Don\'t truncate long labels, allow wrapping to maintain readability',
  ]}
  dos={[
    '- Use Radio Group when users must choose only one option from a set of two or more',
    '- Ensure each radio has a clear and concise label, wrapped text is preferable to truncated labels',
    '- Keep the number of radios concise (ideally 2 to 5) to avoid overwhelming the user',
    '- Consider using a Toggle instead of a two-option Radio Group when the options are affirmative/negative (e.g., "Enable notifications" yes/no)',
    '- Group related radios together with a visible label or legend to provide context',

![Component anatomy](./base-assets/components/radio-group/anatomy.png "Component anatomy")

1. **Radio Group**
2. **Radio button**
3. **Label**

<Heading label="Placement" level={ 2 } />

**Radio Groups** should be vertical, meaning one radio button under another.

Usage of horizontal **Radio Groups** should only occur if vertical space is limited.

<Heading label="Behavior" level={ 2 } />

Radio button can be hovered, focused, clicked or disabled. When disabled, radio button cannot be focused nor clicked.

When clicking on one of the radio button or its linked label, the radio button is selected or deselected depending on the previous state.

Radio button behavior does work only when used in a situation of a **Radio group**.
The **Radio group** can be in an error state, but also in a disabled state. It also can be focused and hovered.

<Heading label="Variation" level={ 2 } />

Radio buttons follow the native behavior of the browser used, so the appearance of radio buttons may vary depending on the browser.

<Heading label="Navigation" level={ 2 } />

<Heading label="Focus Management" level={ 3 } />

When the **Radio Group** component is focused, focus is automatically set to the first focusable and not disabled radio in the group.

If a radio button is checked, focus moves to that checked item when the component is focused.

A read-only radio button can receive focus but cannot be selected or modified.

If a radio button is disabled, it cannot receive focus and cannot be selected.

Focus moves through the radio buttons sequentially.

<Heading label="General Keyboard Shortcuts" level={ 3 } />

Pressing `Tab` moves focus to the next focusable and enabled radio button in the group.

Pressing `Shift` + `Tab` moves focus backward through the radio buttons.

Pressing `Arrow Down` or `Arrow Right` moves focus and selects the next radio button in the group.

Pressing `Arrow Up` or `Arrow Left` moves focus and selects the previous radio button in the group.

Pressing `Space` when focused on an unchecked radio button selects it.

<Heading label="Accessibility" level={ 2 } />

This component complies with the <ExternalLink href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/radio/">Radio Group WAI-ARIA design pattern</ExternalLink>

Try to keep a vertical spacing of at least `8px` between each radio buttons, to provide sufficient tactile and visual separation.
