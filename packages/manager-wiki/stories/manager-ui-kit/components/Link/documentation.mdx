The pre-formatted Link is a customizable, purpose-driven link component that enhances the ODS Link by incorporating visual and functional elements such as icons

<StorybookHeading label="Overview" level={2} />

<StorybookIdentityCard

  githubUrl={Link.github.Link}
  name="ActionMenu"

  Its primary role is to provide clear and intuitive navigation options (e.g.,
  "Back," "Next," or external redirections) while maintaining consistency with
  the overall design system.

<StorybookHeading label="Anatomy" level={2} />

**An ODS Link** which contains:

1. An ODS Icon depending of the usage: External, Back or Next
2. A label: a clear text label that describes the action or destination

<StorybookHeading label="Usage" level={2} />

A **pre-formatted Link** is ideal for:

**External Link**: clearly communicating that the user will leave the current context

- **"Back" Link**: providing an option to navigate to a previous page or step
- **"Next" Link**: guiding users to the next step in a process or section

<StorybookHeading label="Dos & Don'ts" level={2} />

<StorybookBestPractices
  dos={[
    'Use clear, concise labels for the Link',
    'Use the appropriate variant with the link type (e.g., external link for external navigation)',
  ]}
  donts={[
    'Do not use for inline Link where iconography adds no value',
    'Avoid overloading a page with too many pre-formatted Link; prioritize simplicity',
  ]}
/>

<StorybookHeading label="Placement" level={2} />

Similar to a standard link and ODS Link, a **pre-formatted Link** can:

- Stand alone on a page
- Be embedded within a sentence or paragraph for contextual navigation

<StorybookHeading label="Behavior" level={2} />

**States**
The **pre-formatted Link** inherits its states from the ODS Link. These states include:

- **Hover**: Link becomes underlined, and its color changes
- **Focus**: Visual focus indicator, outline, appears
- **Click**: Activates the link, redirecting the user
- **Visited**: After a user has clicked on the link, the color changes to indicate that the destination has already been visited
- **Disabled**: Link is non-interactive; it cannot be clicked or focused

When users clicks anywhere on the **Link**, even its icon, they are redirected to the expected page or section.

<StorybookHeading label="Variation" level={2} />

**Pre-formatted Link** has three predefined variants based on usage:

- External
- Back
- Next

<StorybookHeading label="Accessibility" level={2} />

_Ensure the component meets accessibility standards.
