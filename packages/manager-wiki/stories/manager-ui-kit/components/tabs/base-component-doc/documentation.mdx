<Heading label="Dos & Don'ts" level={ 3 } />

<BestPractices
  donts={[
    '- Don\'t use Tabs as a progress indicator or wizard steps',
    '- Don\'t nest Tabs inside other Tabs, this creates a confusing and hard-to-navigate experience',
    '- Don\'t overload the interface with too many tabs. Use dropdowns if you need more than 5 tabs',
    '- Don\'t use long or verbose labels',
    '- Don\'t use external links or actions as tab triggers, Tabs should only control the visibility of in-page content',
  ]}
  dos={[
    '- Use Tabs to group related content under the same page when it fits in a shared context',
    '- Keep Tab labels short, clear, and scannable, use nouns or very short phrases (1â€“3 words max)',
    '- Use Tabs for horizontal navigation, not hierarchical structure or progressive steps',

![Component anatomy](/assets/base-assets/components/tabs/anatomy.png "Component anatomy")

1. **Tabs**
2. **Scroll Buttons (previous/next) - optional**
3. **Active tab**
4. **Unselected tab**

<Heading label="Placement" level={ 2 } />

**Tabs** are often used in the top part of a web page, as it can act as a navigation focus.

<Heading label="Behavior" level={ 2 } />

By default, one of the **Tab** is always selected.

Each **Tab** can be hovered, focused and selected. A **Tab** can also act as a disabled **Tab**.

**Tabs** always stay on the same line, and can be horizontally scrolled through if they happen to not fit their container.

Each **Tab** has a panel displaying content. Selecting a **Tab** displays the corresponding panel.

The panel does not depend on the **Tab** component, it is in the developer's hands.

<Heading label="Scroll Buttons" level={ 3 } />

When the number of **Tabs** exceeds the visible container width, left and right scroll buttons can be displayed to allow horizontal navigation.

Clicking a button scrolls to the next or previous group of **Tabs** that were not visible.

When at the first tab, the left button is displayed but disabled.

When at the last tab, the right button is displayed but disabled.

Scroll buttons do not affect tab selection. They only change the visible portion of the **Tabs** list.

<Heading label="Navigation" level={ 2 } />

<Heading label="Focus Management" level={ 3 } />

When focus moves to the **Tabs** component, it is set on the active **Tab**.

Once a **Tab** is focused, its associated content is also activated.

<Heading label="General Keyboard Shortcuts" level={ 3 } />

Pressing `Tab` moves focus into or out of the **Tabs** component while keeping the active **Tab** selected.

Pressing `Arrow Right` moves focus to the next **Tab** and activates its content.

Pressing `Arrow Left` moves focus to the previous **Tab** and activates its content.

Pressing `Home` / `fn` + `Arrow Left` moves focus to the first **Tab** and activates its content.

Pressing `End` / `fn` + `Arrow Right` moves focus to the last **Tab** and activates its content.

Pressing `Home` / `End` jumps to the first or last **Tab**, even if these **Tabs** are not currently visible. In this case, the **Tabs** list automatically scrolls to bring the selected **Tab** into view.

Arrow navigation moves focus to the next or previous **Tab**, even if it is not currently visible. In this case, the **Tabs** list automatically scrolls to bring the focused **Tab** into view.
