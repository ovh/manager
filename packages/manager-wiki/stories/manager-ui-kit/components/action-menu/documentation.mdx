  to trigger various actions.
</StorybookIdentityCard>

<StorybookHeading label="Anatomy" level={2} />

1. **an ODS Button**: it will trigger the list of action which contains:

   1. an ODS Icon always at left
   2. a label

2. **an ODS Popover** which can contain:
   1. **actions**: each action is an ODS Button or an ODS Link depending of the usage

<StorybookHeading label="Usage" level={2} />

An **Action Menu** is typically used when users have 3 to 10 actions to choose from (like edit, copy or view settings for instance).

It is used for navigation or command menus, where an action is initiated, based on the selection.

<StorybookHeading label="Dos & Don'ts" level={2} />

<StorybookBestPractices
  dos={[
    'Do use an Action Menu when there are 3 or more actions',
    'Keep Action Menu list of actions content short for a better and faster understanding',
  ]}
  donts={[
    "Don't use an Action Menu to display more than 10 actions or a list of actions causing users to scroll",
    "Don't use an Action Menu when a description is necessary: use a Tooltip instead",
  ]}
/>

<StorybookHeading label="Placement" level={2} />

While opened, the **Action Menu** displays a list of actions. The list of actions can be triggered at the top, bottom, left or right of the **Action Menu** itself.

An opened **Action Menu** will appear above other elements on a page so, make sure the position of your list of actions doesn't hide important information related to the **Action Menu** on the page.

<StorybookHeading label="Behavior" level={2} />

**States**
**Action Menu** does not have its own states. States come from its inner components used as trigger and actions: ODS Button.

The list of actions width will adapt to its longest content until it reaches the maximum width allowed.

When an action content cannot fit on a single line, the text will be truncated.

  data={{
    columns: ['action', 'interaction'],
    rows: [
      {
        action: 'Move cursor over the Action Menu',
        interaction: 'Hover on the Action Menu trigger element',
      },
      {
        action: 'Click on the Action Menu',
        interaction: 'List of actions will be displayed',
      },
      {
        action: 'Move cursor over actions',
        interaction: 'Hover on the hoverable action (when not disabled)',
      },
      {
        action: 'Click on hovered action',
        interaction:
          'Trigger the expected behavior from the selected item and close the Action Menu',
      },
      {
        action: 'Click outside the Action Menu element',
        interaction: 'The Action Menu will close',
      },
    ],
