<Meta title="Manager React Components/Hooks/useBreadcrumb" />

## Overview

The `useBreadcrumb` custom React hook is designed to dynamically generate a breadcrumb trail for navigation within an application. It leverages React Router's `useLocation` to track the current route and a context (`ShellContext`) to fetch navigation URLs. This hook simplifies breadcrumb management, providing a consistent structure for routing in applications using the OVH Manager Shell.

## Key Features

- Automatically resolves the root breadcrumb using the OVH Manager Shell's navigation API.
- Dynamically generates breadcrumb paths based on the current route.

## Usage

To use `useBreadcrumb`, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that your application is wrapped with `ShellContext` and uses React Router.
2. Import and use the `useBreadcrumb` hook in your component.

<Source
  code={`
import React from 'react';
import { useBreadcrumb } from './useBreadcrumb';

const MyComponent = () => {
const breadcrumbs = useBreadcrumb({
rootLabel: 'vRack services',
appName: 'vrack-services',
hideRootLabel: true|false
});
`} language="javascript" />
