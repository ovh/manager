Welcome to the OVHcloud Manager documentation. This guide will help you understand the architecture, components, and best practices for developing with our platform.

## Overview

The OVHcloud Manager is a comprehensive web application that provides a unified interface for managing OVHcloud services. It's built using modern web technologies and follows strict design and development guidelines.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: CSS Modules
- **Component Library**: ODS (OVHcloud Design System)
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library
- **Build Tools**: Webpack

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with the following key aspects:

- **Component-Based Structure**: Reusable UI components
- **Feature-Based Organization**: Code organized by feature modules
- **State Management**: Centralized state handling
- **API Integration**: RESTful API communication
- **Routing**: Client-side routing with React Router

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error handling
- Write comprehensive tests
- Document all components and functions

### Component Development

1. **Structure**
   - One component per file
   - Clear component hierarchy
   - Proper prop typing
   - CSS Modules for styling

2. **Best Practices**
   - Keep components small and focused
   - Implement proper error boundaries
   - Use proper naming conventions
   - Follow accessibility guidelines
