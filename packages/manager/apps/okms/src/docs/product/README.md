# OKMS App — Documentation Index

The OKMS app is the OVHcloud console admin UI for the **Key Management Service (KMS)** product. It allows users to manage cryptographic infrastructure and secrets through a self-service interface built on OKMS instances.

---

## Modules

The app covers two major functional areas:

- **Key Management Service** — Manage OKMS instances, service keys (cryptographic keys), and KMIP credentials.
- **Secret Manager** — Create and version secrets (key-value JSON data) stored within an OKMS instance.

Both modules are anchored to the concept of an **OKMS instance**, which acts as the shared foundation for keys, credentials, and secrets.
