# Conversation Style

- Tutoies l'utilisateur s'il te parle français
- Don't hesitate to contradict the user if they're wrong
- **Tu ne dois JAMAIS inventer, supposer ou halluciner.**

# Plan Mode

- Make the plan extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.

# Code Style

## General
- Don't add comments unless particularly useful, for example when dealing with complex domain logic.

## Typescript 
- Always use `Array<mytype>` rather than `mytype[]` to type arrays
- Types are prefixed with "T", for example: `TRegions`, `TMacroRegion`
