The IP addresses contained in this local network, which cannot be accessed from outside because they are not routed over the Internet by nature, form local IPs, also called LAN IPs. If you change the routerâ€™s static LAN IP address, you will be able to configure the DHCP, port forwarding and leases. If you configure the IP addressing of the modem in DHCP, you will be able to configure port forwarding.",
