These different options allow users to choose the approach that best suits their requirements for resilience, availability, and performance.",
  "pci_instance_creation_select_deployment_mode_help_p2": "1-AZ Region: These single-zone regions are optimal for workloads where cost optimization is a priority. They are perfectly suited for general needs such as storage, backup, or applications whose availability requirements do not necessitate multi-zone redundancy. They offer a good compromise between reliability, performance, and cost control.",
  "pci_instance_creation_select_deployment_mode_help_p3": "3-AZ Region: This model is designed for critical applications requiring high availability and increased resilience. By replicating data across three distinct availability zones, 3-AZ regions significantly reduce the risk of downtime, ensuring business continuity even in the event of incidents affecting one or more zones. This level of redundancy is particularly suited to demanding production environments. To find out more, click here.",
