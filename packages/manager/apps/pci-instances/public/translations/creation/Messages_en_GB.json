These different options allow users to choose the approach that best suits their requirements for resilience, availability, and performance.",

They offer a good compromise between reliability, performance, and cost control.",

By replicating data across three distinct availability zones, 3-AZ regions significantly reduce the risk of downtime, ensuring business continuity even in the event of incidents affecting one or more zones. This level of redundancy is particularly suited to demanding production environments. To find out more, click here.",
