[![Downloads](https://badgen.net/npm/dt/@ovh-ux/ng-ovh-web-universe-components)](https://npmjs.com/package/@ovh-ux/ng-ovh-web-universe-components) [![Dependencies](https://badgen.net/david/dep/ovh-ux/ng-ovh-web-universe-components)](https://npmjs.com/package/@ovh-ux/ng-ovh-web-universe-components?activeTab=dependencies) [![Dev Dependencies](https://badgen.net/david/dev/ovh-ux/ng-ovh-web-universe-components)](https://npmjs.com/package/@ovh-ux/ng-ovh-web-universe-components?activeTab=dependencies)

We extracted all the components of the [web control panel](https://github.com/ovh/manager/tree/master/packages/manager/apps/web) in order to interconnect them
both in our upcoming [monorepo](https://github.com/ovh/manager) but also in the current stack.

At the end we are planning remove this repository and privilege the management of sources directly
inside the monorepo.
