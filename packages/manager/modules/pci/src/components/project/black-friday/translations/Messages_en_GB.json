  "pci_projects_black_friday_notice": "*This special offer is reserved solely for new Public Cloud customers, and is limited to one subscription to the offer per NIC handle. By activating it, your pre-paid OVHcloud account will be credited with an additional amount equivalent to your order, with a limit of five-hundred pounds (£500) maximum ex. VAT. The credit can be used for all new projects created with Public Cloud instances. The credit is used in accordance with the standard pricing applicable and available on the OVHcloud website (including hourly or monthly billing, and Linux or Windows options). To use the service with the additional credit, you need to accept the applicable terms of service listed on the OVHcloud website, unless any SLAs are applied. The credit provided by OVHcloud is valid for a duration of six (6) months from the order date of the Black Friday offer (double your credit), and is activated when you create a new project via the OVHcloud Control Panel. The credit provisioned by OVHcloud on your pre-paid OVHcloud account is automatically deducted from your next bills until the credit is used up, or until the validity period has passed. This credit has no monetary value, and thus cannot be exchanged, transferred or refunded. Once the credit provisioned by OVHcloud has run out, your bills will be paid using the standard credit purchased during the Black Friday offer, and under the standard pre-paid credit conditions. Once you have used up your standard credit, your OVHcloud customer account will be debited each time you use the service. For this reason, you need to have a valid payment method saved in the OVHcloud Control Panel. If you would like to cancel this service without incurring any additional fees, you will need to cancel your Public Cloud projects in the OVHcloud Control Panel before your usage exceeds what is covered by the credit.",
